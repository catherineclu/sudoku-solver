Sudoku Solver Project
PDS 2022 Final Project - Catherine Lu

This project is a simple sudoku puzzle solver.

The sudoku solver utilizes 3 primary files: the Main class, which runs the solver; the SudokuSolver class, which houses
the bulk of the logic/the puzzle-solving algorithm, and the GUI, which displays the user interface.

It is also necessary to have separate .txt files that hold the desired sudoku puzzles to be solved. These files serve
as input for the SudokuSolver class, and there is an option to select these files from the device through the GUI. While
I've included some sample sudoku boards, it's quite easy to make your own as well. The file is formatted visually like
a sudoku board would be; it consists of 81 numbers with 9 lines of 9 numbers, all separated by spaces. Each number
corresponds with the value at a location on the board, and 0 corresponds with an empty space.

Once the main method is run, the interface will pop up with an empty sudoku grid and 3 buttons. Press "Choose File" and
select one of those .txt files from the device. The grid will then display the starting conditions of that sudoku board.
Press solve, and the empty spaces will fill with the correct numbers. At any point, pressing restart will empty the
entire grid, and another file can be chosen. Closing the window terminates the program.
